        <p class="card-text">  A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests. Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.

            <h3 class="card-title">Gavi</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Gavi Eco-Tourism , a project of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation, has caught the attention of tourists for a while now. The project is exclusive in many respects and the majority who visited were nature lovers and adventure tourists. Over a short period of time visitors to Gavi gradually increased, especially after 'Alistair International' the world acclaimed tourism major listed it among the leading eco-tourism centres and one of the must-see places in India.
              <br>A highlight of the Gavi Eco Project is the involvement of the local populace in its activities as guides, gardeners and cooks. This provides livelihood for the locals and also helps to create awareness on the conservation of nature. Gavi, located in Pathanamthitta district offers its visitors activities like trekking, wildlife watching, outdoor camping in specially built tents and night safaris.
              The road leading to Gavi is blanketed by tea plantations, which itself is a refreshing experience. En route to Gavi are places of interest like Mundakayyam, Kuttikanam, Peermedu and Vandiperiyar from where the road deviates to Gavi.
            <br>Once you reach Gavi the serene eco-lodge 'Green Mansion' awaits you like a mother to embrace you in its protective fold. From the 'Green Mansion', one can savour the spectacular view of the Gavi Lake and the adjoining forests. Besides the accommodation provided in 'Green Mansion' visitors can also try out the tree houses here and can even pitch tents in the wilderness. Here one can have outstanding trekking experiences, which are overseen by trained local people. Those who would love to be left alone can do so in the tranquil environs of Gavi or may even go canoeing in the placid waters of the lake or enjoy a breathtaking sunset. Visitors are usually provided vegetarian food and snacks, which further adds to the eco-friendly ambience of the place.

            <h3 class="card-title">Sabarimala</h3>
            <p class="card-text">One of the most famous pilgrim centres in India is the Sabarimala Temple. It is situated on the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats at an altitude of 914 m above sea level and is accessible only by foot from Pamba (4 km). The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Sree Ayyappa.
                <br>Pilgrim season is from November to mid-January. Mandalapooja and Makaravilakku are the two main events of the pilgrim season. The Temple stays closed during the rest of the year except for the first five days of every Malayalam month and during Vishu (April).
            </p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Aranmula – the Heritage Village</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Visitors to Pathanamthitta district are never really sure of what to expect from Aranmula. This is mostly due to the lore surrounding this exotic village, famous for the genius of its craftsmen and the ancient vibe one experiences the moment oneenters. Aranmula is famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’ and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on.
                <br>It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the largest vegetarian feasts in India.
                <br>Its legendary Vijnana Kalavedi houses some of the finest classes and teachers for a variety of art forms like Kathakali, classical dances, classical music and Kalaripayattu. Visitors can stay here for an extended period and observe the ancient crafts being passed on diligently to the next generation.
                <br>A trip is never complete without obtaining one of its special metal mirrors- the beautiful Aranmula Kannadi. From being gorgeous souvenirs to exquisite wedding gifts, these are unique to this locale and haven't yet been replicated anywhere else in the world.

            <h3 class="card-title">Perunthenaruvi</h3>
            <p class="card-text">With woods wrapped in mystery, idly flowing dreamy streams, captivating waterfalls and an exuberant wilderness, Perunthenaruvi is a lesser known gem waiting to get discovered!
                 Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, one of the major pilgrim centres of South India, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home turf of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning the “River of Honey”.
                <br>There is no better place to have a pleasant peaceful time than when you are romancing with nature and surround yourself with its purity to cleanse your soul. Perunthenaruvi offers you just that.
                You can either choose a 5-minute walk or a 20-minute trek through the tea plantations to reach the waterfalls here. The music of the cascades welcomes you even from afar. The hike leads you to a luxuriant waterfall with a luscious swimming hole that tempts one to leap into its deep waters. The stream gushes further beyond through the rocky bed to unite with the holy Pamba. The river Pamba is attributed with divine grace because of its connection with Kerala’s largest pilgrim center Sabarimala.
                <br>Located on the lap of the majestic Western Ghats, Perunthenaruvi adorns herself with her ever gorgeous waterfalls and the mystic lush forest glides that wrap her in their serene arms.  Kudamurutty and Vechoochira are the two shores of the waterfall. 

                There are two waterfalls at Perunthenaruvi - the 300 feet Panamkudantha and the 200 feet Padivathil – both of these originate from the dense woods of Sabarimala.
                <br>In every sense Perunthenaruvi is the ideal spot to recharge and rejuvenate your tired soul.
