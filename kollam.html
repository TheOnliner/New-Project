        <h3 class="card-title">Kollam</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            Blessed with a long coastline, it is the de facto leader of the cashew trade and processing industry in India.
Over a third of its surface is covered by the great Ashtamudi Lake, the entrance to the renowned backwaters of Kerala. Get onboard a houseboat and let the beautiful landscape transport you to an age where nature resided in our midst. An eight hour ride via this route to Alappuzha is among the most sought-after and picturesque trips that Kerala has to offer.
People love visiting the Ashtamudi Backwaters along with the Thenmala Ecotourism Centre, Palaruvi Waterfalls, Jatayupara and Alumkadavu. One can also go and relax at the nearby beaches, namely Kollam, Thirumullavaram and Thangasseri.

            <h3 class="card-title">Jatayu Adventure Center</h3>
            <p class="card-text">The world’s largest bird sculpture and within it a rock theme park for adventure enthusiasts is what today pays tribute to the mythical bird from the Indian epic Ramayana – Jatayu. Legend has it that Jatayu tried to save Sita (wife of Lord Rama) when Ravana, a demon king, was abducting her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and fallen on these rocks, grievously injured.
                <br>The Jatayu Adventure Center (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam, 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture, adventure, leisure, and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic that renders the story of Jatayu add to the magic of the destination.
                <br>The Jatayu Adventure Center offers the largest adventure park within a natural terrain. Paintball, valley crossing, bouldering, zip line, trekking, archery, rappelling, jumaring and wall climbing are among the myriad activities available here. The climbing activities are designed around the natural rock formations on the hillside. While you are relishing the adrenaline rush the park offers you make sure you explore the multi cuisines at the food court with a panoramic view and the age-old Siddha Cave Healing Center as well for a complete, wholesome experience.

            <h3 class="card-title">Thenmala Ecotourism</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Thenmala, which lies at the conjunction of the Kollam-Shencottah road and the Trivandrum-Shencottah Road, boasts of India's first planned Ecotourism destination. It has 10 Ecotourism spots that cover the great hill ranges of Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Kollam districts. ‘Thenmala’ translates to 'Honey Hill' and so it is no surprise that high quality honey is exported from this area. The surrounding dense forest is also known for the timber that is in much demand across the country. Its terrain is dotted by forests, rubber and tree plantations and was selected by the World Tourism Organisation as one of the premier eco-friendly projects in the world.
                <br>Thenmala is located 66 kms to the east of Kollam and is a treasure trove of activities. From boat rides to leisurely walks to even adventure sports like mountain biking and rock climbing, we have you covered on all fronts. The staff is well trained in providing the required help and information at all times. Visits to the Thenmala Dam are open to tourists and the view is renowned all across the area. The sway bridge available at the Leisure Zone is a favourite among children. The winding pathways, boardwalk and sculpture garden are all worth spending an evening at. The deep woods of Thenmala contain specially made tree huts where one can escape into a separate zone in the forest. It is a surreal experience, vouched for by all our visitors.
                <br>Visits to Thenmala also include opportunities to observe some very unique spots. The Nakshatravanam, a nursery of trees that are considered sacred to the 27 constellations, has people thronging to it to take home a sapling of the tree related to their own birth star. A visit to the nearby Deer Rehabilitation Centre is a must as various species of deer are bred here. They are released into the forest when the population reaches optimum levels. A boat ride in the majestic Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary caps off a memorable trip to Thenmala. The rare flora and fauna on display are truly exquisite and will remain etched in your memory forever.

            <h3 class="card-title">Munroe Thuruth</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In the deep reaches of Kollam, there is a pristine, expanse of greenery that will be of interest to the members of the great Scottish Clan, Munroe, who are scattered across the globe. Precisely for the two crores fourty lakh members of the Munroe Clan! It must be noted that just a few places named after the Clan exist and this islet in Kerala named after a Munroe should not be given a miss.
                <br>An endless stretch of emerald green waters polka-dotted by green stretches of land, the Munroe Island in Kollam is a green paradise indeed.
                The Munroe Island is a cluster of eight small islands that lie comfortably against the placid backwaters. The ideal way to experience the charm and rhythm of life at the islands is by ferrying in a country boat through its green labyrinth.
                <br>This backwater island village has been named after Colonel John Munroe, the British Resident of erstwhile Travancore State. He contributed significantly in integrating several backwater regions by digging canals. 
                This slice of greenery lies nestled at the confluence of the Ashtamudi Lake and Kallada River, around 27 km off Kollam. The antiquity of the islet can be traced back to the age of megaliths and Stone-Age tools.
